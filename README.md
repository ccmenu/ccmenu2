# CCMenu

CCMenu shows the status of builds on CI/CD servers in the menu bar.

This repository holds the new version of CCMenu, rewritten from the ground up using Swift and Swift UI.

## Bugs / Contributing / Help

You can ask for help or contribute to the future development of CCMenu by discussing or suggesting features in the GitHub [discussions](https://github.com/ccmenu/ccmenu2/discussions).

If you suspect that you have found a bug, please open an [issue](https://github.com/ccmenu/ccmenu2/issues). For now there is no template, but please try to include as much information as possible. The easier it is to reproduce the bug, the more likely it is to be fixed.

Pull requests that fix known bugs are welcome. Please try to add a unit test that demonstrates that the bug was fixed. Of course, you can also open a PR with a new feature, but please keep in mind that adding new features may need some discussion. In such cases, new unit tests as well as integration and UI tests (where applicable) should be added.


## Feature ideas

Below are some ideas for future features. There's no roadmap for their implementation, and some are probably never going to be implemented. 

- Sounds (was a feature in the class CCMenu)
- Workflow-specific GitHub tokens
- Support for updating passwords of cctray pipelines
- Improved accessibility
- Support for localisation / localisation
- Avatar in notifications (committer or repo owner)
- Support for log in with GitHub (is this even possible?)
- GitHub API access as a GitHub app (currently CCMenu uses OAuth)
- Pipeline groups with submenus 
- [Nevergreen](https://github.com/build-canaries/nevergreen)-style dashboard (full screen window)
- Embedded libjq to transform feeds from other CI servers
